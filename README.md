#Blockchain Betting Game

Blockchain Betting Game is an exciting decentralized betting game built on the Ethereum blockchain. It allows players to place bets using Ether and try their luck in a transparent, fair, and secure gaming environment.

#How It Works
Betting
Players create bets by sending Ether to a smart contract.
Each bet is associated with specific game rules and odds.
Players can choose the amount they want to bet and the outcome they are betting on (e.g., high/low, odd/even, specific numbers, etc.).
Bets are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and immutability.
#Smart Contracts
The game is powered by Ethereum smart contracts, which automate the betting process.
Smart contracts enforce the rules, calculate payouts, and ensure a fair game.
Payouts are automatically distributed to the winners.
#Randomness
Random numbers are generated using Chainlink VRF (Verifiable Random Function) to ensure fairness and unpredictability.
Players can trust that the game's outcomes are not manipulated.
#Winnings
When a bet is won, the player's winnings are automatically sent to their Ethereum wallet.
Winnings are determined by the bet amount, odds, and the game's outcome.
